# Haskell Cocoa

Hopefully this is going to be a very simple and grow-on-demond Cocoa-Haskell bridge.


## Cocoa Classes

Each class provided by Cocoa (i.e. mostly in AppKit and Foundation framworks) is bridged by three files.
- <code>HNS___.hs</code>
- <code>HNS___.h</code>
- <code>HNS___.m</code>
